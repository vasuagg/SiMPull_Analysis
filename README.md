# SiMPull_Analysis
This repository contains two MATLAB codes used to do SiMPull Analysis.
The input files for the Counts_Giri.m code is .pks files and for Coloc_Giri.m is .traces file which can be generated by using the smFRET package found free on https://cplc.illinois.edu/software/ or available on request from vaggrwl2@illinois.edu.

We determine the average and standard deviation of number of single fluorescence spots from many different images stored in a folder. This code is Counts_Giri.m. 

The second code allows determination of the percentage colocalization with respect to total YFP molecules between two overlapping images. One image is taken by exciting YFP molecules and other by exciting mCherry molecules. Both the images are taken from the same imaging area. This code is Coloc_Giri.m. 

The input files are .pks and .traces files generated using the IDL software package which can found at cplc.illinois.edu/software/
